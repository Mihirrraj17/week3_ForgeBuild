## RentChain
* A decentralized rental management platform designed to automate and secure the relationship between landlords and tenants. This project leverages the speed of Foundry for smart contract development and the power of Next.js for a seamless user experience.
## Key Features
* Automated Rent Payments: Securely handle ETH/Token transfers between tenants and landlords.

* Owner-Only Withdrawals: Integrated access control (as seen in your withdraw function) ensuring only the contract owner can claim funds.

* Real-time Transaction Status: Frontend integration using ethers.js or viem to provide users with instant feedback via browser alerts and transaction tracking.

* Robust Testing: A comprehensive test suite built with Foundry (RentContractTest.t.sol) to ensure contract security and reliability.
